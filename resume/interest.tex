  \descriptionstyle{I am primarily interested in Software Engineering research with a focus on improving software reliability and security.
In particular, I devise novel program analysis techniques to analyze existing code properties and apply advanced
machine learning and NLP models to learn from those properties. Such models help me building tools that automate
program development, bug detection, and program repair for real-world large scale software.}
